======

This repository contains R code and its related documentation for the Coursera Data Science / Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

The raw data can be obtained from:

* <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip><sup>1</sup>


The data used for this project was downloaded from the link above on Tuesday May 20th, 2014.

The following files were used within the '"getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip' archive (all other files were ignored):
* UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
* UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
* UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
* UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt


The codebook for this project can be found in a file named **CodeBook.md** in this repository.

The R file named **run_analysis.R** (also in this repository) was used to generate the output data submitted for the course project.

In the R file (run_analysis.R) is assumed that the 'getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip' file has been extracted into the current working directory.
